Streaming-attention
====
* Provide [codes](https://github.com/HaoranMiao/streaming-attention/blob/master/attentions.py) of streaming attention mechanisms for end-to-end automatic speech recognition using Pytorch

* Provide [algorithms](https://github.com/HaoranMiao/streaming-attention/blob/master/algorithm.pdf) of the implementation of these streaming attention mechanisms for better understading

* Compatible to [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet)

Stable Monotonic Chunkwise Attention (sMoChA)
----

sMoChA is described in "[Online Hybrid CTC/Attention Architecture for End-to-End Speech Recognition](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2019/abstracts/2018.html)" by H Miao, G Gao, P Zhang, T Li, Y Yan, in Proceedings of Interspeech 2019.

Monotonic Truncated Attention (MTA)
----

MTA is described in "[Online Hybrid CTC/attention End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition Architecture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9072325)" by H Miao, G Gao, P Zhang, Y Yan, in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing. Also see [manuscript](https://github.com/HaoranMiao/streaming-attention/blob/master/mta.pdf) for brief description.
